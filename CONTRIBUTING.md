# Contributing
Thank you for considering making the library better!

## File Structure
The `src/` folder contains all the code for the library. You should not add any library code outside of this folder.
The `test/` folder is for tests. Each file contains a comment describing what the tests aim to achieve.
The `index.d.ts` file is used to document each function, so use it carefully!

## Commits
Commits start with a capitalize letter, and aim to be as descriptive and as short as possible. Please use punctuation.

## CHANGELOG
Use it to document what you have changed, they are in the form of
```
M/D/YYYY V.V.V
[DESCRIPTION]
```

Happy hacking!
